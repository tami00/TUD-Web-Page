	The College of of Engineering & Built Environment, Bolton Street located in the heart of Dublin City was founded in 1911 as an technical institute specifically designed and built for technical and technological education.
	Courses provided included construction, civil and mechanical engineering, architecture, and printing. 
	Indeed, in 1914 the institute developed the first day-release apprenticeships courses for printing in the country, three afternoons each week for compositor and letterpress machine operators
	Now as part of the Dublin Institute of Technology (founded in 1992) the Bolton Street campus houses the College of Engineering & Built Environment offering a wide range of engineering programmes on both a full-time and part-time basis.
	<p></p>
	The prospectuses, from the earliest days as a College of Technology to the present DIT College of Engineering & Built Environment, 
	provide a history of how the educational demands of Irish society have changed and chart the development of the college from being 
	a provider of technical education to a higher education institution providing first class teaching and research facilities.
