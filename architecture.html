	<h2><b> What is... Architecture? </h2></b>	
	<p></p>
	Architecture is the art and science of designing space. Students considering this career should have a creative aptitude for architectural design 
	and the organisational ability to implement their designs in practice. They should also have an interest in artistic and cultural aspects of society
	as well as an aptitude for technical and managerial challenges.

	<h2><b> What are my... Career Opportunities? </h2></b>
	<p></p>
	The qualification is for the profession of Architecture. Architects are concerned with the design and construction of buildings.
	They may practice in a personal professional capacity, or in employment in private and public sector organisations. 
	The field of practice is quite extensive in Ireland and abroad and may offer alternatives of general practice or specialisation throughout a career.
	Many graduates have pursued very successful careers abroad and others have gone on to become prominent architects in Ireland.
	
	<h2><b> What other options do I have after completion? </h2></b>
	<p></p>
	Entrants to the programme have the option of completing the five year continuous B.Arch Degree with full professional accreditation under the government 
	‘free fees scheme’ or - subject to reaching the required academic standard - 
	they can choose to study the year and a half Masters of Architecture programme after completing four years successful study.
	
	<h2></b> Learning Outcomes: What will I Study? </h2></b>
	<p></p>
	This five year programme covers topics such as design studio, history theory and criticism of architecture,
	environment, construction, visual and digital communications, computer applications and law.
	The majority of the student experience centres around studio based design projects which allow the student to design buildings
	and explore the urban and rural context. There is a strong emphasis on studio work and exploring the students’ own understanding 
	of architecture throughout the programme. <br></br>

    The DIT degree in Architecture is recognised throughout EU member states. 
	Following two years of postgraduate experience they may take the examination in Professional Competence and
	thus become members of the R.I.A.I and register as an architect.
